    "description": "This model is based on the SE69 guitar made in 1884 by Torres. Antonio de Torres (1817-1892) can be considered as the \"father\" of the Spanish classical guitar, developping the \"fan bracing\" system. His instruments are light, have a very thin top, and are characterised by a \"percussive\" bass, warm trebbles, and an overall very \"round\" sound. The pictures hereafter show pegheads, but I can of course build an instrument with machine heads, following the head design of the Torres SE43 that I was able to examin in the musical intrument museum in Paris.",

The original guitar from 1917 belongs to Catherine Marlat's collection in Paris. It is one of my favourite instruments, with an incredibly colourful, warm and full sound. Although it is not a particularly loud instrument, I would highly recommand this model if you are looking for a complex and rich sound.",
